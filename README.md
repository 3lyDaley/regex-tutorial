## General Information

<p>
In order to learn more about the functions within a common regex, I researched the meaning of their components and compiled my findings in a tutorial, as I understand them. The amount of symbols (and lack of whitespace) made it difficult for me to understand how they are organized, and how to dissect them section by section. <br>
The goal is to promote a basic level of understanding in using Regex expressions that have already been made until I am comfortable enough to learn how to write custom expressions for unique scenarios. This tutorial is to encourage others to do the same!

- [This tutorial](https://medium.com/factory-mind/regex-tutorial-a-simple-cheatsheet-by-examples-649dc1c3f285) goes through defining each element step by step, and is a very helpful breakdown.
- [This article](https://www.regular-expressions.info/backref.html) elaborated on back-referencing a little more & really helped secure the meaning.
